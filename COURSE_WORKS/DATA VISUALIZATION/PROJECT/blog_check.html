        Walking into the Data Visualization class on the first day, I had no idea what to expect. Within moments, we learned that the entire semester would revolve around team presentations—and that we’d be doing them ourselves. Honestly, it was a bit of a shock. Presentations? For a whole semester? The only saving grace was the announcement that there wouldn’t be any exams. Still, participation would be critical, and the uncertainty of what lay ahead was nerve-wracking.  
      </p>  
      <p>  
        In the beginning, things felt manageable. By the end of August, our professor was teaching us the basics of data visualization and how to structure impactful presentations. The pace felt good, and it gave us some breathing room to adjust.  
      </p>  
      <p>  
        Then September arrived, and the first team was up for their presentation. Everyone in the class was on edge, waiting to see how it would go. To our surprise, they delivered an incredible presentation, full of confidence and clarity. It was inspiring to watch—but it also triggered a bit of fear. Could our team do this? Would we meet that level of quality when our turn came?  
      </p>  
      <p>  
        As more teams presented, we started to understand the rhythm of the course. Toward the end of September, our team was tasked with a rebuttal against another group’s topic: Geospatial Analysis. We felt prepared and ready to challenge them, but when the moment came, their presentation was flawless. We didn’t even have a chance to rebut—it was that good.  
      </p>  
      <p>  
        When October rolled in, so did our own presentation date. A small miracle happened: our presentation got postponed to the following week, giving us extra time to prepare. When the big day finally arrived, the nerves kicked in. Our team had put in the work, and we presented with as much confidence as we could muster. It wasn’t perfect—we went over the time limit—but the feedback we received was overwhelmingly positive. That moment of relief after it was all over? Priceless.  
      </p>  
      <p>  
        Not long after, another team presented on Tableau and Power BI, tools that are essential for data visualization. Their session stood out for how much we learned—practical tips and features that we hadn’t even considered before.  
      </p>  
      <p>  
        The semester wasn’t just about presentations; there were group assignments too. The first few were tough. We worked hard but kept losing small marks for details we overlooked. It was frustrating, but those small setbacks taught us to be more meticulous.  
      </p>  
      <p>  
        Then November rolled around, bringing the final stretch of the semester and one of the most challenging tasks: creating a poster. We had no idea how to start, and the deadline was looming. After a chaotic brainstorming session, we finally landed on a solid idea. The next day, we submitted a poster we were genuinely proud of. That experience taught us more than just design skills—it showed us the value of teamwork under pressure.  
      </p>  
      <p>  
        As the semester came to an end, I looked back on how much had changed. What started as an intimidating journey became a period of growth and learning. We didn’t just learn about data visualization—we learned how to collaborate, present confidently, and embrace challenges.  
      </p>  
      <p>  
        A huge thank you to Professor Zaruba for leading us through this journey. This course didn’t just teach us skills for our careers; it gave us memories and experiences we’ll carry with us for a long time. This semester was unforgettable, and I’m so grateful for it.
